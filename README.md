# HTML, CSS, TypeScript Part 3
To start coding open your terminal and write
```
npm i
```

When all packages have been installed run:
```
npm start
```

After running `npm start`, open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

For each exercise, you'll find a dedicated folder within the exercises directory. Make sure to complete your work within these folders. For instance, exercises/exercise1 contains the files for the first exercise (script.ts, style.scss, and index.html). When you're working on Exercise 1, you should only modify the files in the exercise1 folder. This keeps everything organized and ensures that each exercise is self-contained.

***Please do not add any additional files.***
